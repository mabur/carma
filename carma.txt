* Assume GNU C.
* Type inference via GNU C extension.
* Pass structs by value and do not use const by default. Enforce functional style via convention instead of compiler.
* Containers implemented via convention:
  - Arrays with size known at run-time. first, last
  - Arrays that can grow and shrink. first, last, last_allocated
* Algorithms implemented via macros and GNU C extensions:
  - For each
  - Copy
  - Fill
  - Find
  - erase_if
